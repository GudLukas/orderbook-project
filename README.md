# Orderbook System

## Introduction

A financial Orderbook System, primarily for the front office of an investment bank.

It will provide a backend API via Flask that will manage buying and selling orders, while providing an ability to view the current state of the orderbook.

The system will later utilise React-based frontend and a database for a more permanent storage solution.

We are also considering ways of using AI for enhanced trading insights and possible automation.

## Our Goal

Aiming to provide a robust, scalable, and customisable orderbook solution, and offering management through our API.

Build a foundation for more advanced analytics through AI driven support.

## Audience

Primary - front office teams at investment banks.

Secondary - developers seeking out a flexible foundation for custom trading tools and analytics.
