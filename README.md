# orderbook-project

A financial Orderbook System, primarily for the front office of an investment bank.

It will provide a backend API via Flask that will manage buying and selling orders, while providing an ability to view the current state of the orderbook.

The system will later utilise React-based frontend and a database for a more permanent storage solution.

We are also considering ways of using AI for enhanced trading insights and possible automation.
